**Sighn in kiosk:** <br>
The iea for this program came from contractors at work sighning into a paper logbook. The problem with this was that they kept it in a toolbox outside and 
the wind and the rain would destroy the record of them being on site.

**Idea:** <br>
Have a wetherproof tough sighn in computer you can throw in your tool box and not worry too much about. The sign in recors will be locally contaned but it can be downloaded 
to a external USB drive. In the case of a evacuation you will be able just grab the box and see who signed in.
